## Gathering scripts to extract and clean bibliometric data

This github repository gathers different scripts to extract (mannually
or via APIs) and then clean bibliometric data.

At this point, you will find:

-   a [script](/cleaning_scripts/scopus_clean.md) to clean the data
    extracted from [Scopus website](https://www.scopus.com/), but also
    to extract data using Scopus APIs and [rscopus
    package](https://johnmuschelli.com/rscopus/index.html);
-   a [script](/cleaning_scripts/dimensions_clean.md) to clean the data
    extracted from [Dimensions](https://dimensions.ai).

These scripts are draft scripts, which could be improved in many ways. I
share them because they still can be useful or because it could trigger
some collaborative work to make them better. In other words, this github
repository is intended both as a pedagogical resource for historians of
economics and other social scientists as well as a platform for listing
and manipulating the different bibliometric databases.
